# Spring
- What is spring container?
  - Manages spring beans and their lifecycle.
  - Once you create java classes and once you create the configuration, the IOC container creates the runtime system for us.
  - IOC container is one who creates spring context and manage the beans for us.
    1. Bean Factory: Basic Spring container
    2. Application Context: Advanced Spring container with enterprise-specific features.
- Difference between POJO, Java Bean, Spring Bean
  - POJO
    - Every java object is POJO.
  - Java Bean
    - Compulsory no arg constructor should be there -> which is by default available there.
    - There should be getters and setters.
    - Class should be Serializable.
    - 
  - Spring Bean
    - Any Java object that is managed by Spring container is known as Spring beans.
- Different Types of dependency injection
  - Field Injection
    - @Autowired does field injection.
  - Setter Injection.
    - Make the setters annotated with @Autowired
  - Constructor injection.
  - Spring team recommends constructor based injection.
- Some important Terminologies
  - @Component - An instance (spring bean) of that class will be managed by Spring framework.
  - Dependency:
    - Some bean dependent on some other classes/its beans.
  - @ComponentScan
    - How spring will find out component classes.
    - It scans packages.
  - Dependency Injection:
    - Identify the beans and their dependencies and wire them together(provides IOC).
  - Spring beans 
    - Any object that is managed by Spring framework is known as Spring beans.
  - IoC container: Manages the lifecycle of beans and dependency.
    - There are two types of IoC container, Application Context and Bean factor.
    - Recommended is Application context (which is complex) and bean factory is rarely used.
    - 
  - Autowiring:
    - Process of wiring in dependencies for Spring bean is called as Autowiring.
- Difference between @Component & @Bean
  - Places used:
    - @Compoenent -> Used at class level to create a bean.
      - Easy as just add one annotation on class.
    - @Bean -> Used on methods to create bean.
      - You need to write all the code for bean creation.
  - Autowiring:
    - @Component -> Field, Setter or Constructor injection.
    - @Bean -> Method call or Method parameters.
  - Who creates the beans
    - @Component -> Spring creates the bean.
    - @Bean -> You need to write the bean creation code.
  - Finally, which one is recommended:
    - Instantiating beans for your own application code then go for @Component
    - For custom business logic or for third party libraries go for @Bean
### With Spring Framework:
  - Instead of focusing on object, their dependencies and wiring spring frameworks helps us to focus on business logic of your application.
  - Spring framework manages the lifecycle of objects.
    - And For this just 
      - Mark the components using @Component annotation.
      - Mark the  dependencies using @Autowired annotation.
      - Allow spring framework to do the magic.
  - @Lazy
    - Used to lazily initialise the beans (at its first use).
    - By default, its eager initialisation, because we can catch errors if any at the time of application startup itself.
  - Spring Bean Scopes
    - Scopes applicable only for web-aware Spring application context.
      - Session scope -> Object instance per user session.
      - Request Scope -> Object instance for every HTTP request.
      - Application Scope -> Object for whole application scope.
      - Websocket scope.
    - SCOPE_PROTOTYPE
      - Returns new instance of the bean every new time.
    - SCOPE_SINGLETON
      - This is by default.
      - Returns only once created class always.
    - Java Singleton vs Spring Singleton
  - Spring Stereotype Annotations:
    - @Component
      - Generic annotation applicable for any class.
      - This is the base for all stereotype annotations.
      - Specializations of @Component:
        - @Service:
          - Class with business logic
        - @Controller:
          - Used to define controllers in our web applications and in our REST api.
        - @Repository:
          - Used when the class is talking to database.
    - It's always recommended to use the most specific annotation because
      - Suppose if it is @Repository then Spring automatically wires the JDBC Exception translation features.

### World before Spring Boot
  - Manage frameworks and versions.
  - Configure Dispatcher servlet for Spring MVC
  - Additional Spring configurations.
  - Some non-functional requirements.
    - Logging.
    - Error handling.
    - Monitoring.
  - Most imp goal of Spring Boot:
    - Help to build PRODUCTION READY applications quickly.
      - Quickly:
        - Spring Initializer.
        - Spring boot starter project.
        - Spring boot Auto Configuration.
        - Spring boot Dev-tools.
      - Production Ready:
        - Logging -> Like for diff Env.
        - Diff configs for environment.
        - Monitoring (Actuator)
